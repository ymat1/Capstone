                    A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a
                    bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and
                    kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.

                        One reason is the presence of glutamates, which our brain interprets as the "meaty"
                        flavor associated with umami. If you're not a vegetarian, we have a feeling that you're
                        a fan of steak. And why not? You should be. A hunk of beef, cut into a perfect portion,
                        seasoned, and seared on a ripping hot grill or a cast-iron pan is one of the most
                        delicious things you'll ever eat, anywhere. But why, exactly, is our steak so delicious?
                        Let's break it down...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fat, it's flavor, as they say, and a well-marbled steak has plenty of it. That rich
                        mouthfeel and strong flavor of beef is a hard one to not love.

                        The Maillard Reaction, No, it's not the name of a Robert Ludlum novel; the Maillard
                        reaction is the complex chemical reaction that occurs when meat meets heat. As the meat
                        begins to brown, the amino acids and carbohydrates in it create a wide range of chemical
                        compounds that give it that deep, rich flavor and mahogany color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The texture, a perfectly-cooked steak in your mouth is nearly impossible to describe.
                        The slight chew, the tenderness, the juiciness... It all combines into a mouthful unlike
                        any other.

                        Our brains have been hard-wired over the course of thousands of years to enjoy the taste
                        of beef, so what are you waiting for? Make your table reservation now and eat with both
                        your nose and your eyes before your mouth, when a gorgeous steak is placed in front of
                        you, it smells really, really good. As you eat you continue to pick up all that aroma,
                        creating a multi-layered sensory experience.

                    A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground
                    meat,
                    typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with
                    cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup,
                    mustard,
                    mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and
                    are
                    frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a

                        The answer, according to scientists, lies in meat's unique mixture of fat and umami
                        (more about this taste later), spiced up in a process called the Maillard reaction — the
                        browning that happens when we cook a piece of meat, and that's exactly how we do things

                    There is absolutely no denying that pizza is one of the best foods ever invented. Italian food
                    in general is top tier, but pizza holds the gauntlet as it is, perhaps, the best food ever
                    created. The best thing about pizza is that it is totally customizable. From the base, to the
                    sauce, to the cheese, to the toppings, you can choose different options to create a pizza that
                    is totally unique to you. If you have ever sat and thought about pizza, like lots of us
                    have, you might be wondering which toppings are the most popular.
